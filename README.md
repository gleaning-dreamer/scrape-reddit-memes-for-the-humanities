# scrape reddit memes for the humanities
 scraping memes! from reddit! for the humanities!
 This is the notebook I have been using to get memes from reddit with PRAW.
 I am still working on this script. New features will include automatic downloading of meme images for your dataset pleasure.
 This collects data which will be useful for the humanities and tracking the spread and use of memes over time on reddit.
 I bet you could compare it to other sites too for more interesting humanities fun times.
 Later I will also add sentiment analysis which can be useful for getting a measure of affect on said memes..
